# HOI

So this is just a small list of things I use in my daily life.... I
don\'t really use the computer to game much so IDK what to put in as my
gaming software.

I mainly write my code in the terminal with either neovim or helix
(Shoutout silt) or Emacs for taking notes and such. In fact this site
was made using Org mode!

I have a pretty good Neovim config I am proud of. [Here\'s the link to
that](https://github.com/fruity-fkf/nvim). I put a **LOT** of time into
making that ;-;

I also use Doom emacs because configuring emacs is a pain in the fookin
ass to configure due to a lack of documentation.

As for my Operating system I prefer NixOS because it makes managing my
development envirorments easier on all my computers. So I can have a
consistent experience on any computer I own.

As for my colorscheme it just depends on my mood. Though the two most
used themes are Catppuccin mocha and Gruvbox material dark hard
(shoutout silt).

## Here\'s a list of some tools I use in my daily life:

-   Terminal emulator: [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty)
    (Decently fast, supports ligatures and the kitty backend for
    rendering images is nice IG)
-   Terminal file browser: [*yazi*]{.spurious-link
    target=" https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi"} (Honestly I don\'t know
    any other file manager that can compare)
-   Window manager: [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) (Dogshit dev but
    the WM itself is pretty nice (I hate it the only reason I use it is
    for gesture support))
-   Terminal multiplexer: [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) though
    I\'ve recently been using [zellij](https://zellij.dev/) recently
    because it is more \"easy\" out of the box

IDK what else to say so uhhh byee
